ProStack provides an API for file uploads, powered by Vercel Blob storage. This API allows you to upload files and receive URLs to access them.

## File Upload Endpoints

### Upload File

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
POST /api/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

// Form data with 'file' field containing the file to upload
```

```json Response
{
  "name": "example.jpg",
  "contentType": "image/jpeg",
  "url": "https://example-blob-storage.vercel-storage.com/app/image-1626284400000.jpg",
  "size": 153284
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This endpoint uploads a file to the Vercel Blob storage and returns metadata including the public URL to access the file.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the upload process, the API will return an error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Failed to upload file"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- No file provided in the request
- Unsupported file type
- File size exceeds limits
- Storage service unavailable

## Authentication Requirements

The upload API may require authentication depending on your application's configuration. Make sure to include your authentication token if necessary:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

## Supported File Types

ProStack supports the following file types for upload:
- Images: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp
- Documents: pdf, doc, docx, txt
- Other media files as configured

ProStack uses Better-Auth to provide a comprehensive authentication system. The authentication API handles user registration, login, session management, and integration with Polar for subscription management.

## Authentication Flow

All authentication endpoints are managed by Better-Auth and are available under the `/api/auth` path. The authentication system supports:

- Email/password authentication
- Social login (Google)
- Password reset
- Team/organization management
- Subscription and billing integration with Polar

## Polar Subscription Endpoints

ProStack integrates with Polar for subscription and billing management. The following endpoints are available for authenticated users:

### Checkout a Product/Plan

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
GET /api/auth/checkout/{product-slug}
```

```text Response
// Redirects to Polar checkout page for the specified product
```
</CodeGroup>

This endpoint initiates the checkout process for a subscription plan. The user must be authenticated, and the `{product-slug}` must match one of the available plan slugs configured in the application. After successful checkout, the user is redirected back to the application.

### Access Customer Portal

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
GET /api/auth/portal
```

```text Response
// Redirects to Polar customer portal
```
</CodeGroup>

This endpoint redirects authenticated users to their Polar customer portal where they can manage their subscriptions, billing information, and payment methods.

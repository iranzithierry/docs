ProStack includes API endpoints for managing team invitations, allowing users to accept or reject invitations to join teams.

## Team Invitation Endpoints

### Accept Team Invitation

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
GET /api/team/accept-invitation?invitationId=inv_123456
```

```json Response
// On success, redirects to dashboard with welcome message
```
</CodeGroup>

This endpoint accepts a team invitation and adds the authenticated user to the team. If the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the sign-in page with a callback to the accept invitation URL.

### Reject Team Invitation

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
GET /api/team/reject-invitation?invitationId=inv_123456
```

```json Response
// On success, redirects to dashboard
```
</CodeGroup>

This endpoint rejects a team invitation, removing it from the user's pending invitations.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the invitation process, the API will return an HTML response with an error message:

```html
<h3>Error message</h3>
<p>Try again later or contact support.</p>
```

Common error scenarios:
- Invalid invitation ID
- Expired invitation
- User already in team
- Insufficient permissions

## Authentication Required

Both endpoints require authentication. If the user is not authenticated when accepting an invitation, they will be redirected to:

```
/auth/sign-in?callback=<encoded_accept_invitation_url>
```

ProStack includes a complete email system for sending transactional emails using React Email templates and Resend as the delivery provider.

## Email Features

- **Customizable Templates**: All emails are built with React components
- **Responsive Design**: Emails look great on all devices
- **Branding Control**: Easy customization of colors, logos, and content
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
- **Delivery Tracking**: Email delivery and open rates (via Resend)

## Email Types

ProStack includes several pre-built email templates for common use cases:

### Authentication Emails

- **Email Verification**: Sent when a new user signs up (if enabled)
- **Password Reset**: Sent when a user requests a password reset

### Organization Emails

- **Team Invitation**: Sent when a user is invited to join an organization

### Marketing Emails

- **Waitlist Confirmation**: Sent when a user joins the waitlist

## How Emails Work

ProStack uses [React Email](https://react.email/) for building email templates and [Resend](https://resend.com) for delivery:

```tsx
// Example of sending an email with ResendClient
const mailObject = {
    to: user.email,
    react: EmailVerification({ user, url, token }),  // React component as email
    subject: `${siteConfig.name} - Email verification`,
    from: `${siteConfig.name} <${siteConfig.emails.from}>`,
};
resendClient.emails.send(mailObject);
```

## Email Components

All email templates are built using reusable components found in `components/mails/mail-components.tsx`:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `MailContainer` | Container for the entire email |
| `MailBody` | Email body with proper styling |
| `MailTitle` | Title/heading for the email |
| `MailText` | Paragraph text with proper styling |
| `MailButton` | Call-to-action button |
| `MailFooterText` | Footer text with smaller size |

## Customizing Emails

You can customize the email templates to match your brand:

### 1. Update Email Templates

Modify the React components in `components/mails/` to change the content and design:

```tsx
// Example: Customizing the email verification template
export const EmailVerification = ({ user, url }: { user: User; url: string; token: string }) => (
    <Html>
        <Head />
        <Preview>Verify Your Account</Preview> {/* Change the preview text */}
        <Tailwind>
            <MailBody>
                <MailContainer>
                    {/* Customize the title */}
                    <MailTitle>Welcome, {user.name}! Please Verify Your Email</MailTitle>
                    
                    {/* Customize the content */}
                    <MailText>
                        Thanks for creating an account with {siteConfig.name}!
                        Please verify your email address to get started.
                    </MailText>
                    
                    {/* Customize the button */}
                    <MailButton href={url}>Activate My Account</MailButton>
                    
                    <MailFooterText>
                        If you didn't create this account, no action is needed.
                    </MailFooterText>
                </MailContainer>
            </MailBody>
        </Tailwind>
    </Html>
);
```

### 2. Update Site Configuration

Update the email settings in `resources/site.ts`:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  // Other config...
  emails: {
    from: "noreply@yourdomain.com",
    contact: "support@yourdomain.com",
  },
  // Other config...
};
```

## Email Integration Points

The email system is integrated with several features in ProStack:

### Authentication Integration

Emails are sent at key points in the authentication flow:

```typescript
// From lib/auth/index.ts
emailAndPassword: {
    // ...
    sendResetPassword: async (props) => {
        if (isProd) await sendResetPasswordEmail(props);
        console.log("Sending reset password email", props);
    },
},
emailVerification: {
    sendOnSignUp: siteConfig.auth.emailVerification.enabled,
    autoSignInAfterVerification: true,
    sendEmailVerification: async (props) => {
        if (isProd) await sendVerificationEmail(props);
        console.log("Sending verification email", props);
    },
},
```

### Organization Integration

Emails are sent when users are invited to organizations:

```typescript
// From lib/auth/index.ts
organization: organization({
    // ...
    sendInvitation: async ({ email, organization, inviter, invitationUrl }) => {
        if (isProd) {
            await sendOrganizationInvitationEmail({
                email,
                inviterName: inviter.name || inviter.email,
                inviterEmail: inviter.email,
                organizationName: organization.name,
                inviteLink: invitationUrl,
            });
        }
        console.log("Sending organization invitation", { email, invitationUrl });
    },
}),
```

### Waitlist Integration

Emails are sent when users join the waitlist:

```typescript
// Example from waitlist join form submission
const result = await joinWaitlist(formData);
if (result.success) {
    await sendWaitlistEmail({ email });
}
```

## Email Testing

During development, email sending is logged to the console rather than actually sent (unless in production mode). This allows you to see the content of emails without sending real messages.

To test emails in development:

1. Check your console logs to see email content and recipients
2. For testing real email delivery, use Resend's test mode or set up a development API key

## Environment Variables

Configure the email system with these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key for sending emails | Yes |
| `RESEND_EMAILS_DOMAIN` | Domain for sending emails with Resend | Recommended |

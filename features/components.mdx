ProStack uses [JustD](https://getjustd.com/) as its component library, providing a comprehensive set of customizable, accessible UI components built on modern web standards.

## What is JustD?

JustD is a modern component library similar to shadcn/ui but with additional features and optimizations. It offers:

  return (
    <Card className="p-6 max-w-md mx-auto">
      <Card.Header>
        <Card.Title>Sign Up</Card.Title>
        <Card.Description>Create an account to get started</Card.Description>
      </Card.Header>
      <Card.Content className="space-y-4">
        <Input placeholder="Email" type="email" />
        <Input placeholder="Password" type="password" />
        <Button className="w-full">Create Account</Button>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

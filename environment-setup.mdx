title: 'Environment Setup'
description: 'Configure your development environment for ProStack'
---

This guide covers the configuration of your development environment to work effectively with ProStack.

## Code Editor Setup

We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the following extensions for the best development experience:

- **ESLint**: JavaScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: Auto-completion for Tailwind CSS classes
- **Prisma**: Syntax highlighting and formatting for Prisma schema

## VS Code Configuration

ProStack includes recommended VS Code settings to maintain consistency across your team. These settings are stored in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
    "cSpell.words": [
        "customsearch"
    ]
}
```

You can extend these settings based on your team's preferences.

## Git Configuration

ProStack includes a `.gitignore` file configured for Next.js projects:

```plaintext
# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js
.yarn/install-state.gz

# testing
/coverage

# next.js
/.next/
/.idea/
/out/

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem

# debug
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# local env files
.env*.local

# vercel
.vercel

# typescript
*.tsbuildinfo
next-env.d.ts

.env
```

## Code Formatting

ProStack uses Prettier for code formatting. The configuration is defined in `.prettierrc`:

```json
{
  "printWidth": 100,
  "tabWidth": 4,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "singleQuote": false,
  "jsxBracketSameLine": false,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "useTabs": false,
  "semi": true
}
```

To format your code manually, you can run:

```bash
bun run format
```

## TypeScript Configuration

ProStack is configured with TypeScript for type safety. The TypeScript configuration can be found in `tsconfig.json`.

## Environment Variables

ProStack uses environment variables for configuration. For a complete list of required and optional environment variables, see the [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment-variables) page.

## Pre-commit Hooks

ProStack can be configured with pre-commit hooks using Husky to ensure code quality before committing changes. This includes running linters, formatters, and tests.

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up your development environment, you're ready to start developing with ProStack:

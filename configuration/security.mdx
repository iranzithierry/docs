This guide covers important security considerations and best practices for your ProStack application.

## Authentication Security

ProStack includes a secure authentication system with several protective measures:

### Password Security

- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Password reset tokens are time-limited and single-use
- Rate limiting is applied to login attempts

### Session Management

- Sessions are managed with secure HTTP-only cookies
- CSRF protection is built into form submissions
- Session timeout is configured for security

## Environment Variables

Protect your environment variables:

- Never commit `.env` files to your repository
- Use different environment variables for development and production
- Rotate API keys and secrets regularly
- Store production secrets in a secure vault service

## API Security

When building APIs with ProStack:

- Use authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate all user inputs
- Use CORS to restrict API access to trusted domains

## Database Security

Protect your database:

- Use strong, unique passwords for database access
- Restrict database access to specific IP addresses
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing it
- Implement row-level security for multi-tenant applications

## Frontend Security

Client-side security considerations:

- Use HTTPS for all communication
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Sanitize user-generated content before displaying it
- Apply proper input validation

## Dependency Management

Keep dependencies secure:

- Regularly update dependencies with `bun update`
- Run security audits with `bun audit`
- Monitor for security advisories
- Consider using dependabot for automated updates

## Production Deployment

For production deployments:

1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
2. **Headers**: Configure security headers:
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-XSS-Protection

```typescript
// Example Next.js middleware for security headers
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  
  // Set security headers
  response.headers.set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  response.headers.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  response.headers.set('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
  response.headers.set('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
  
  return response;
}
```

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in ProStack:

1. **Do not** disclose it publicly as an issue
2. Send details to [hidden]@gmail.com
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. We'll acknowledge receipt and work on a fix

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [x] All default passwords are changed
- [x] Debug mode is disabled
- [x] Error pages don't leak sensitive information
- [x] Logging is configured appropriately
- [x] Database backups are in place
- [x] HTTPS is properly configured
- [x] Authentication is working correctly
- [x] Rate limiting is implemented

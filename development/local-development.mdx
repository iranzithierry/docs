This guide explains how to effectively develop your application using ProStack's development workflow.

## Development Server

Start the development server with:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using Bun (Recommended)
bun run dev
```

```bash Using npm
npm run dev
```
</CodeGroup>

The development server will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot reloading enabled.

## Project Structure

ProStack follows a modular structure to keep your code organized:

```

app/                  # Next.js app directory
├── (app)/            # Main application routes
│   ├── (more)/       # Additional pages (terms, privacy, waitlist)
│   ├── auth/         # Authentication pages
│   ├── chat/         # Chat feature
│   └── ...
├── actions/          # Server actions
├── api/              # API routes
└── ...
components/           # Shared UI components
lib/                  # Utility functions and shared code
resources/            # Static resources
public/               # Public assets
...
```

## Development Scripts

ProStack includes several npm scripts to help with development:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `bun run dev` | Start the development server |
| `bun run build` | Build the application for production |
| `bun run start` | Start the production server |
| `bun run lint` | Run ESLint to check for code issues |
| `bun run db:push` | Push schema changes to the database |
| `bun run db:studio` | Open Prisma Studio to manage database |

## Working with Components

ProStack includes a set of reusable UI components in the `components/` directory. These components are built with accessibility and performance in mind.

### Example: Using a Button Component

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui";

export default function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <Button 
            intent="primary" 
            onPress={() => console.log("Button clicked")}
        >
            Click Me
        </Button>
    );
}
```

## Working with Server Actions

ProStack uses React Server Actions for server-side operations. Here's an example of a server action for joining a waitlist:

```tsx
"use server";

import { db } from "@/lib/db";

export async function joinWaitlist(formData: FormData) {
    const email = formData.get("email") as string;
    
    if (!email) {
        return { success: false, message: "Email is required" };
    }
    
    try {
        await db.waitlist.create({
            data: { email }
        });
        
        return { success: true, message: "You've been added to the waitlist!" };
    } catch (error) {
        return { success: false, message: "Failed to join waitlist" };
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

ProStack includes a standardized approach to error handling:

1. Use try/catch blocks for server-side operations
2. Return structured error responses from server actions
3. Use toast notifications (via Sonner) for user-friendly error messages

## Debugging

For debugging your Next.js application, you can:

1. Use the built-in Chrome DevTools for client-side debugging
2. Add console logs with `console.log()` for quick debugging
3. Set the `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect'` environment variable for server-side debugging

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' bun run dev
```

ProStack includes PM2 configuration for robust production deployment. PM2 is a daemon process manager that helps you manage and keep your application online 24/7.

## What is PM2?

PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications. It allows you to:

- Keep applications alive forever
- Reload applications with zero downtime
- Facilitate common system admin tasks
- Manage application logging, monitoring, and clustering

## PM2 Configuration

ProStack comes with a pre-configured `ecosystem.config.js` file in the root directory:

```javascript
/**
 * This files is used in production when running the app in background with pm2
 * @example
 * ```bash
 * pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
 * ```
 */
export const apps = [
    {
        name: "app",
        script: "npx",
        args: "next start --port 3020",
        env: {
            PORT: 3020,
            NODE_ENV: "production",
        },
        watch: false,
        max_memory_restart: "1G",
        autorestart: true,
        restart_delay: 1000,
        log_date_format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss Z",
        error_file: "logs/error.log",
        out_file: "logs/output.log",
        merge_logs: true,
        kill_timeout: 5000,
        no_daemon: false,
    },
];
```

## Configuration Options Explained

The ecosystem file configures the following options:

| Option | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `name` | "app" | Name of the application in PM2 |
| `script` | "npx" | The command to run |
| `args` | "next start --port 3020" | Arguments passed to the script |
| `PORT` | 3020 | The port on which the application runs |
| `NODE_ENV` | "production" | Environment setting |
| `watch` | false | Disable file watching (more stable in production) |
| `max_memory_restart` | "1G" | Restart if memory exceeds 1GB |
| `autorestart` | true | Automatically restart if the app crashes |
| `restart_delay` | 1000 | Wait 1 second before restarting |
| `log_date_format` | "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss Z" | Format of log timestamps |
| `error_file` | "logs/error.log" | Where error logs are stored |
| `out_file` | "logs/output.log" | Where output logs are stored |
| `merge_logs` | true | Merge logs from all instances |
| `kill_timeout` | 5000 | Wait 5 seconds before force killing |
| `no_daemon` | false | Run PM2 as a daemon |

## Installing PM2

Before using PM2, you need to install it globally on your server:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

## Deploying with PM2

To deploy your application with PM2:

1. Build your Next.js application:

```bash
bun run build
```

2. Start the application with PM2:

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

## Managing Your Application

### View Application Status

```bash
pm2 list
```

This shows all running applications, their status, resource usage, and uptime.

### View Application Logs

```bash
pm2 logs app
```

To view just errors:

```bash
pm2 logs app --err
```

### Restart the Application

```bash
pm2 restart app
```

### Stop the Application

```bash
pm2 stop app
```

### Delete from PM2

```bash
pm2 delete app
```

## PM2 Monitoring

PM2 provides a simple monitoring interface:

```bash
pm2 monit
```

This command opens a dashboard showing real-time metrics about your application.

## Setting Up PM2 to Start on System Boot

To ensure your application starts automatically when the server reboots:

```bash
pm2 startup
```

Follow the instructions provided by the command to set up the startup script.

Then save your current PM2 configuration:

```bash
pm2 save
```

## PM2 Ecosystem File Extensions

You can extend the ecosystem file to support multiple environments or applications:

```javascript
export const apps = [
  {
    name: "app-production",
    // Production settings
  },
  {
    name: "app-staging",
    // Staging settings
  }
];
```

description: 'Deploy ProStack using Docker for consistent environments'
---

ProStack includes Docker support for containerized deployment, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.

## Docker Setup

ProStack comes with a pre-configured Dockerfile in the root directory:

```dockerfile
# ---- Building Stage ----
FROM oven/bun:latest AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY bun.lockb package.json ./

RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

COPY . .

RUN bun run build

# ---- Production Stage ----
FROM oven/bun:latest AS runner

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/package.json /app/bun.lockb ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next .next
COPY --from=builder /app/public public
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules node_modules

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["bun", "run", "start"]
```

## Docker Environment Variables

For Docker deployments, ProStack provides a separate environment file:

1. Copy the Docker environment example file:

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
```

2. Update the variables in `.env.docker`:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

DB_USER=<username>
DB_PASSWORD=<password>
DB_HOST=pghost    # Use 'pghost' instead of 'localhost' for Docker
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=<mydb>

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
```

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t prostack .
```

## Running the Docker Container

To run the application in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.docker prostack
```

## Docker Compose Setup

For a more complete setup with a database, you can use Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    env_file:
      - .env.docker
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME}
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Save this as `docker-compose.yml` in your project root, then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Production Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production with Docker, consider the following:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all production environment variables are set securely
2. **Database Migrations**: Run migrations before starting the application
3. **Health Checks**: Add health check endpoints to monitor your application
4. **Logging**: Configure proper logging for production

## CI/CD Pipeline

You can integrate Docker deployments into your CI/CD pipeline:

1. Build and test the Docker image
2. Push the image to a container registry
3. Deploy the new image to your production environment

## Scaling with Docker

For scaling your application:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Run multiple instances of your container
2. **Load Balancing**: Use a load balancer to distribute traffic
3. **Container Orchestration**: Consider using Kubernetes for larger deployments
